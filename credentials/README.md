## Credentials

contains import credentials that should be gitignored \
I am using google service credential, to set up:
1. navigate to https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete 
2. follow to steps to create and download a service account key for your project (similar structure to "example-google-credentials.json")
3. move it into this folder (it will be gitignored) and rename it as needed according to docker settings
